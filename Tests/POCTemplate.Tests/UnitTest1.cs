    /// - **Arrange**: where the expected outcome is defined.
    /// - **Act**: where the actual method or functionality would be invoked (currently not implemented in this test).
    /// - **Assert**: where the expected outcome is compared to the actual outcome using assertions.
    /// This method serves as a template for unit testing, ensuring that the code behaves as expected.
